## `[156]` Triple-Guard Ensemble Pooling for Bias-Sensitive Meta-Analysis

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: Ensemble pooled effect estimate (MAE)  
**Data:** Simulated meta-analysis datasets with publication bias contamination

### 156-word body

Can an ensemble of bias-sensitive estimators outperform individual methods for robust point estimation in meta-analyses contaminated by publication bias? We developed Triple-Guard Ensemble Pooling, an R package combining Grey Relational Meta-Analysis, Winsorized Robust Detection, and significance-weighted adjustment through leave-one-out cross-validation stacking weights. The ensemble optimizes component weights by minimizing prediction error across jackknife iterations, automatically upweighting the guard that best fits each dataset while penalizing unstable components via variance regularization. Across 12 simulation scenarios, the ensemble achieved mean absolute error of 0.08 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.12) compared with 0.14 for the best single component and 0.19 for random-effects. Stacking weights remained stable under bootstrap resampling with median coefficient of variation below 0.15 across all contamination levels tested. Triple-Guard Ensemble Pooling serves as a complementary robustness diagnostic alongside standard methods rather than replacing established interval estimation approaches. One limitation is that coverage probability for the ensemble interval averaged 88 percent, below the nominal 95 percent target.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in
  the protocol document linked above.

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
